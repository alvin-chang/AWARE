# AWARE - Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine

AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine) is a sophisticated distributed systems management platform that implements ant colony-inspired algorithms for cluster coordination and resource optimization. It features a self-organizing architecture that dynamically elects leaders, distributes workloads, and maintains system resilience.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The AWARE system implements a distributed architecture with the following key components:

1. **Node Discovery Service**: Discovers and tracks nodes in the distributed system
2. **Leader Election Mechanism**: Implements Raft consensus algorithm for leader election
3. **Resource Management**: Coordinates distributed computing resources using ant-inspired algorithms
4. **API Gateway**: RESTful API service for cluster management operations
5. **Web UI**: React-based dashboard for cluster monitoring and management
6. **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication for secure access

## üöÄ Deployment

The system has been successfully deployed with Docker Compose and is available at:

- **Backend API Service**: http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend UI Service**: http://localhost:3001

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy the system
./deploy.sh

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Restart services
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

## üì° API Endpoints

All API endpoints are documented in the DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md file. Key endpoints include:

- Authentication: `/login`, `/register`
- Cluster Management: `/api/cluster/*`
- Node Management: `/api/nodes/*`
- Alert Management: `/api/alerts/*`
- Resource Management: `/api/resources/*`

## üîê Authentication

The system uses JWT-based authentication with the following default credentials:

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: password
