# AWARE 2.0 — RLM Configuration

**Status:** A1.1 revision. Resolves G1 FINAL findings (12 BLOCKs + 22 FLAGs + 7 ALIGNs) per `~/.openclaw/symphony-v3/workspaces/task-4423/output/findings.json`.
**Owner:** Archimedes (architect).
**Last updated:** 2026-06-28.

This document describes how AWARE 2.0 configures the **RLM (Recursive Language Model)** primitive — the library at `~/src/rlm/` (Zhang, Kraska, Khattab 2026, arXiv:2512.24601) wrapped by the OpenClaw plugin at `~/src/rlm-plugin/`. The primitive is paper-faithful and AWARE-agnostic; AWARE supplies policy.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config/rlm.yaml` | Canonical defaults (this file is the source of truth at boot) |
| `config/rlm.schema.json` | JSON Schema draft-07 validation of `rlm.yaml` |
| `docs/rlm.md` (this file) | Prose: rationale, examples, design decisions, cross-refs, findings resolution |

## Layering

```
~/src/rlm/                 ← library (paper-faithful, no AWARE conventions)
~/src/rlm-plugin/          ← OpenClaw plugin wrapping the library
~/src/AWARE/config/rlm.*   ← AWARE policy layer (THIS work)
```

**Per the F-007 / F-011 / F-015 resolution: the primitive owns enforcement, AWARE owns policy.** Concretely: the library ships its REPL subprocess driver with seccomp + forbidden-imports + landlock; AWARE's job is to set the workspaceDir root, the tool whitelist, the audit field names, the redaction list, the forwarded-options surface, and the kill switch.

## Findings resolved in this revision

The G1 FINAL re-review (`task-4423/output/findings.json`) surfaced 12 BLOCKs + 22 FLAGs. This A1.1 revision resolves them as follows.

## Configuration fields

Every field below corresponds to a key in `config/rlm.yaml`. Env-var overrides follow the `AWARE_RLM_<FIELD>` pattern.

### `rlm.enabled` (boolean, default `true`)

Master switch. When `false`, the adapter short-circuits and never invokes `rlm()`. Audit logs the disablement.

### `rlm.budgetUsd` (number | null, default `null`)

Per-call USD cap. `null` means no cap; cost is always recorded in the audit log but never enforced. Set to a number to opt in to enforcement.

**Design decision (F-024 / F-012):** AWARE has no product-level budget limit. v1 ships with `null` and records cost for observability. Callers who want enforcement set `budgetUsd` themselves. This dissolves the F-024 finding — the default-budget-100%-failure mode cannot exist when enforcement is opt-in.

### `rlm.tree.*` (numbers)

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `maxDepth` | `2` | Tree depth. min 1, max 5 (schema cap). |
| `branching` | `3` | Children per non-leaf. min 1, max 5. |
| `K` | `4` | HeavySkill K-parallel attempts per leaf. min 1, max 8. |
| `preferParallel` | `false` | OOS for v1. ARCHITECTURE §4 reference is the stale doc. |

Default tree at depth=2, branching=3 → 9 leaves.

### `rlm.context.*` (BLOCK-1, BLOCK-11 resolution)

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `allowedTypes` | `[directory, pdf, log]` | v1 enum. SPEC §3.2 wins; ARCH §5 alternatives dropped. |
| `fieldName` | `type` | Field name is `type`, NOT `kind` (per SPEC §3.2). |
| `defaultKind` | `directory` | When no `type` is specified. |
| `maxBytes` | `10485760` (10 MiB) | Hard cap; raises `RlmContextTooLargeError`. |

**Deferred to v1.1** (per ARCHITECTURE §10): `repo`, `buffer`, `sqlite`. `sqlite` deferred because v1 IngestIndex=none and sqlite requires sqlite-vec (BLOCK-11).

### `rlm.forwardedOptions.*` (BLOCK-3, BLOCK-8 resolution)

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `verification.enabled` | `true` | `verification` forwarded to leaves (matches ARCHITECTURE §4 + HeavySkill's verify.js signature). |
| `verification.allowedMethods` | `[exec, llm-judge]` | `exec` is a code-execution vector; documented security consideration. |
| `verification.defaultMethod` | `llm-judge` | Safer default; callers opt into `exec` explicitly. |
| `prm.enabled` | `true` | `prm` forwarded; PRM-weighted aggregation (BLOCK-5). |

### `rlm.tools.allowed` (array of 7 strings)

The 7-tool whitelist: `read, grep, slice, vec_search, len, keys, print`.

**Resolution (BLOCK-7):** union of ARCHITECTURE §5 + SPEC §11, with `sub_lm` dropped (paper §7 marks async sub-calls as future work; `sub_lm` was a v2 feature accidentally listed in v1 docs).

`vec_search` is only meaningful when `IngestIndex != none`; v1 is none, so `vec_search` is a no-op in v1 (no error, just returns empty).

REPL op enforcement is **AST-based** for both Python (stdlib `ast`) and JS (`acorn`). The REPL driver rejects any leaf-emitted code containing disallowed operations, in addition to the library's existing forbidden-imports list.

### `rlm.workspaceDir` (absolute path)

All REPL path operations are confined to this directory. The adapter:

- **Rejects absolute paths outside this root** (F-003).
- **Rejects `..`** in any path component (F-003).
- **Rejects symlinks pointing outside this root** (G1 symlink-traversal finding).
- **Canonicalizes** all paths before comparison.

The default `/var/aware/rlm/workspace` is a placeholder — deployments must set this to a real path (e.g. `${AWARE_DATA_DIR}/rlm/workspace`).

### `rlm.decompositionFormat` (`plain-text`) and `rlm.decompositionScope` (`root-only`)

- **Format:** plain-text with structured delimiters (matches `~/src/rlm-plugin/src/rootPrompt.js`). JSON-shaped decomposition was the stale doc.
- **Scope (BLOCK-4):** root-only for v1. SPEC §6.4 header is correct; the "every non-leaf" interpretation in some A1 prose was a misread.

### `rlm.sandbox.*`

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enforcement` | `required` | Adapter refuses `rlm()` calls without sandbox. |
| `privilegeDrop` | `required` | REPL spawns with `setuid`/`setgid` drop. |
| `opFilter` | `ast-whitelist` | Python `ast` + JS `acorn` AST filter on leaf-emitted code. |
| `seccomp` | `true` | Library's existing seccomp profile (blocks socket/connect/accept/recv/send). |
| `landlock` | `linux-only` | macOS has no landlock; v1 documented as supported-with-caveats. |
| `envMode` | `cleared` | `env -i` (FLAG-18 resolution). SPEC §11 wins over ARCHITECTURE §5's "PATH + LANG only." |
| `rlimitAsMb` | `512` | Per-REPL address-space cap. |
| `rlimitCpuSeconds` | `30` | Per-op CPU cap. |
| `wallClockSeconds` | `2` | Per round-trip wall-clock cap. |

### `rlm.audit.*` (F-008, BLOCK-9, BLOCK-10)

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `component` | `rlm` | Canonical field name; no override. |
| `kindNode` | `rlm_node` | Canonical field name; no override. |
| `costRecorded` | `always` | Cost recorded whether or not budget enforcement is on. |
| `redactFields` | `[userPrompt, contextPayload]` | Stripped before audit-log persistence (F-016). **Sentinel audits before C1 lands.** |
| `preferencePair.discriminatorField` | `component` | `component: 'rlm'` for root-level pair; `component: 'heavy_think'` for leaves. |
| `preferencePair.rootComponentValue` | `rlm` | See above. |
| `preferencePair.leafComponentValue` | `heavy_think` | HeavySkill's existing value; preserved. |
| `preferencePair.schema` | `heavy-skill` | Root pair uses HeavySkill's exact shape (BLOCK-9): `{ts, problem, task_type, chosen: {reasoning, prm_score}, rejected: {reasoning, prm_score}, all_attempts, verification, cost, _content_hash}`. |
| `preferencePair.perCallOnly` | `true` | ONE pair per `rlm()` call (BLOCK-10). The per-internal-node claim in ARCHITECTURE §9 is dropped. |
| `preferencePair.treeSubfield` | `tree` | rlm-specific extension; null for leaves. |

### `rlm.fewShotExamples` (number, default `0`)

v1 ships with zero in-context examples (BLOCK-2 resolution). Matches the `rlm-plugin` README's paper-faithful discipline: no async sub-calls, no guardrails, no HeavySkill integration. Deferred to v1.1 after observing real decompositions.

### `rlm.killSwitch` (boolean, default `false`)

When `true`, the adapter refuses to invoke `rlm()` and audit-logs the refusal. Mirrors the existing `AWARE_KILL_SWITCH` and `AWARE_GATEWAY_KILL_SWITCH` patterns. Env-var override: `AWARE_RLM_KILL_SWITCH`. Lazy getter — takes effect on the next request, no restart.

### `errors.contextTooLargeThresholdBytes` (BLOCK-6)

Threshold for `RlmContextTooLargeError` (which was missing from the v1 error hierarchy). Default 10 MiB. Adapter raises this error when `context.bytes` exceeds the threshold, before invoking the REPL.

## Design decisions (no ADR dir exists in AWARE)

The AWARE repo does not currently have a `docs/adr/` directory; this section captures the load-bearing decisions inline. If/when ADR infrastructure is added, these four decisions should be lifted into numbered ADRs.

### Sandbox boundary

**Decision:** The RLM primitive owns *enforcement* (REPL subprocess isolation, seccomp, forbidden imports); AWARE owns *policy* (workspaceDir root, tool whitelist, redaction, kill switch, forwarded-options surface).

**Rationale:** This is the architectural call that determines who fixes what when something breaks. Future RLM maintainers working on `~/src/rlm/` should not need to know about AWARE conventions; future AWARE security reviewers should not need to read Python lib code to audit the boundary. The two layers are independently auditable.

**Trade-off:** The adapter has to re-implement some validation that the library could (path canonicalization, symlink rejection). This is intentional duplication for boundary clarity.

### Budget posture

**Decision:** Default `rlm.budgetUsd=null` (no cap). Cost always recorded. Enforcement is opt-in per call.

**Rationale:** AWARE has no product-level cost cap (Alvin directive 2026-06-27). Defaulting to null avoids the F-024 failure mode. Recording cost always gives AWARE operators the data they need to set their own cap when they want one.

**Trade-off:** A misconfigured caller could rack up unbounded cost. Mitigated by: (a) audit log always records cost, (b) tree-shape defaults are conservative (depth=2, branching=3, K=4 → 9 leaves), (c) the `rlm.killSwitch` is always available.

### Verification forwarding with code-execution risk

**Decision:** Forward `verification` from `rlm()` to leaves (matches HeavySkill's `verify.js`). Default method `llm-judge`. `exec` method is opt-in and documented as a code-execution vector.

**Rationale:** Block-3 / Block-8 finding. HeavySkill's reality is that leaves can run `verify.js`, which has an `exec` method (runs shell commands). The original SPEC §5.1 was wrong to say verification is "NOT forwarded." Forwarding it is correct, but the security implication needs to be visible at the AWARE layer because the adapter's `workspaceDir` confinement is what makes `exec` safe — without it, `exec` is unbounded host access.

**Trade-off:** Documentation burden is higher; new AWARE operators need to understand that `verification.method: 'exec'` is privileged.

### Context shape (kind vs type)

**Decision:** Field name is `type`, value set is `[directory, pdf, log]`.

**Rationale:** BLOCK-1 / BLOCK-11 resolution. SPEC §3.2 is the more recent doc and the more conservative enum. ARCHITECTURE §5's `kind` field with `[file, dir, repo, buffer]` was either an early draft or a v2 design. Picking the SPEC enum keeps v1 minimal: 3 types, no `sqlite` (which requires sqlite-vec), no `repo` / `buffer` (deferred).

**Trade-off:** If a downstream consumer needs `buffer` (in-memory contexts), they have to wait for v1.1.

## Examples

### Read the configured value at runtime (planned)

The runtime hook for these settings is not yet wired (see "Open work" below). The intended shape:

```javascript
import rlmConfig from '../config/rlm.cjs';
console.log(rlmConfig.budgetUsd);                // null
console.log(rlmConfig.context.allowedTypes);     // ['directory', 'pdf', 'log']
console.log(rlmConfig.tools.allowed);            // ['read', 'grep', 'slice', 'vec_search', 'len', 'keys', 'print']
console.log(rlmConfig.sandbox.enforcement);      // 'required'
console.log(rlmConfig.audit.preferencePair.schema); // 'heavy-skill'
```

### Override via env var (planned)

```bash
export AWARE_RLM_BUDGET_USD=5.00                # opt into $5/call enforcement
export AWARE_RLM_KILL_SWITCH=1                  # disable rlm() entirely
export AWARE_RLM_FORWARDED_OPTIONS_VERIFICATION_ALLOWED_METHODS=exec,llm-judge  # opt into exec verification
```

## Open work

These items are explicitly out of scope for the A1.1 revision. They're called out so the next pass (C1 implementation + G2 re-review) doesn't miss them.

- **Runtime config hook** (`src/config/rlm.cjs`) — mirror `src/config/index.cjs`. Loads `config/rlm.yaml`, validates against `config/rlm.schema.json`, exposes the namespace via `rlmConfig.<field>` and the standard `validate()` / `warnings()` / `snapshot()` API. Forge owns.
- **Sentinel audit of `rlm.audit.redactFields`** — current list (`userPrompt`, `contextPayload`) is best-effort. Sentinel reviews before C1 lands.
- **`workspaceDir` deployment default** — placeholder `/var/aware/rlm/workspace` must be replaced with a deployment-specific value. Possibly `${AWARE_DATA_DIR}/rlm/workspace` once `AWARE_DATA_DIR` convention is settled.
- **macOS landlock follow-up** — v1 documents this as supported-with-caveats; a future version may add a macOS-specific sandbox profile (sandbox-exec profile, gVisor, or similar).
- **BLOCK-12 SPEC.md prose revision** — `sub_calls` needs a corrected definition in SPEC §3.3 (1 per non-leaf node for decomposition + 1 per non-leaf node for aggregation + 1 `heavy_think()` per leaf). Then SPEC §9.2's acceptance test needs to be rewritten. This is prose, not config — but it blocks T1.
- **`preferParallel`** — explicitly OOS for v1; ARCHITECTURE.md reference is the stale doc.
- **`Few-shot examples`** — explicitly deferred to v1.1; SPEC §6.5 mandate is the stale doc.
- **Deferred context types** — `repo`, `buffer`, `sqlite` deferred to v1.1 per ARCHITECTURE §10.
- **Verification.exec safety profile** — `verification.allowedMethods` includes `exec`. The sandbox policy already constrains what `exec` can do (workspaceDir, seccomp, etc.), but a future version may want an additional allowlist of executables.
