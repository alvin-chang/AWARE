# Project Brief: AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine)

## Executive Summary

AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine) is a clustering system that mimics ant colonies to create self-organizing computing clusters. Unlike traditional clusters with pre-defined nodes, AWARE nodes have "DNA" with basic instincts that allow them to dynamically form queen-worker hierarchies. The system aims to enable users to specify cluster requirements (e.g., "a cluster for web traffic with front-end, middleware, database, and storage") without needing to define specific hostnames or MAC addresses.

## Problem Statement

Current clustering solutions like Fuel for OpenStack require extensive pre-configuration of hardware details (hostnames, MAC addresses). This creates friction in deploying flexible, scalable clusters. Users must define infrastructure in detail before deployment, limiting the agility and adaptability of cluster management. The process of creating clusters is complex and requires deep infrastructure knowledge.

## Proposed Solution

AWARE implements a biological metaphor where nodes can self-organize into queen-worker hierarchies. The system focuses on three key APIs:
1. Communication between queen and worker nodes
2. User interface for the queen node
3. Integration APIs for infrastructure tools like Chef/Puppet and OpenStack

This allows users to specify cluster requirements at a high level, while the system automatically provisions appropriate resources.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: DevOps Engineers and Infrastructure Teams

- Professional users managing large-scale computing infrastructure
- Current behaviors include manual cluster configuration and orchestration tasks
- Specific needs include simplified cluster deployment and management
- Goals include reducing configuration overhead and increasing cluster adaptability

### Secondary User Segment: Cloud Platform Administrators

- Enterprise platform administrators
- Current workflows involve resource allocation and cluster maintenance
- Pain points include complex cluster setup and rigid predefined configurations
- Goals include improved resource utilization and automated cluster scaling

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Reduce cluster deployment time by 70% compared to traditional methods
- Support dynamic scaling without manual reconfiguration
- Achieve 99.9% availability for cluster communications

### User Success Metrics
- Time from request to operational cluster: < 10 minutes for common configurations
- Reduction in configuration errors by 80%
- User satisfaction score > 4.0/5.0 for deployment experience

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Cluster formation time: Target average of 5 minutes for basic configurations
- Node discovery rate: 95% of nodes successfully joining clusters
- API response times: < 100ms for core operations

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **Node Discovery:** Automatic broadcast and detection of available nodes
- **Queen Election:** Algorithm for nodes to elect a queen when starting
- **Basic API:** Core communication APIs between queen and worker nodes
- **Simple Cluster Formation:** Support for basic cluster configurations
- **Failover:** Worker nodes can promote a new queen if the old one disappears

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Advanced security features beyond basic authentication
- Complex multi-region cluster setups
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics dashboard
- Integration with multiple cloud providers

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be successful if it can demonstrate:
- At least 3 nodes can form a cluster with automatic queen election
- New nodes can join an existing cluster within 2 minutes
- Failover works correctly when the queen node goes offline

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Advanced security with encryption and authentication
- Auto-scaling based on workload demands
- Multi-cloud deployment support
- Comprehensive monitoring and management dashboard

### Long-term Vision
- Support for complex, multi-region cluster topologies
- Machine learning-based optimization of resource allocation
- Integration with all major cloud providers and container orchestration systems
- Self-healing capabilities with minimal human intervention

### Expansion Opportunities
- Specialized cluster types for different workloads (AI/ML, databases, etc.)
- Marketplace for pre-built cluster configurations
- Enterprise licensing with premium support and features

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Linux-based systems, primarily Ubuntu, CentOS
- **Browser/OS Support:** Web dashboard for cluster management (Chrome/Firefox)
- **Performance Requirements:** Support for clusters up to 100 nodes in MVP

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js for web dashboard
- **Backend:** Go or Python for node communication services
- **Database:** etcd for distributed configuration storage
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Containerized using Docker

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with separate modules for queen, worker, and communication
- **Service Architecture:** Microservices with API-first design
- **Integration Requirements:** REST APIs for integration with Chef/Puppet and OpenStack
- **Security/Compliance:** Basic authentication initially, with plans for role-based access control

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Open source project with volunteer contributors
- **Timeline:** MVP within 6 months
- **Resources:** Limited to individual developer contributions
- **Technical:** Must integrate with existing infrastructure tools (Chef/Puppet/OpenStack)

### Key Assumptions
- Users have access to Linux-based compute resources
- Network connectivity is available between cluster nodes
- Users have basic knowledge of infrastructure concepts
- Infrastructure automation tools are available in target environments

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Technical Risk:** Complexity of implementing reliable leader election algorithms
- **Market Risk:** Existing solutions may meet user needs adequately
- **Resource Risk:** Limited development resources for a complex system

### Open Questions
- How will the system handle network partitions between nodes?
- What specific hardware requirements are needed for optimal performance?
- How will the system handle nodes with different capabilities?

### Research Areas
- Leader election algorithms (Raft, Paxos) for queen selection
- Efficient service discovery mechanisms
- Distributed consensus protocols for cluster state

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on this brief
2. Design the system architecture for the AWARE platform
3. Begin implementation of core node discovery and communication features
4. Set up development environments and CI/CD pipelines
