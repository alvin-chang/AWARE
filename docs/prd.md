# Product Requirements Document: AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine)

## 1. Document Information
- **Product Name:** AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine)
- **Product Owner:** [To be assigned]
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** September 25, 2025
- **Status:** Draft

## 2. Executive Summary

AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine) is a clustering system that mimics ant colonies to create self-organizing computing clusters. Unlike traditional clusters with pre-defined nodes, AWARE nodes have "DNA" with basic instincts that allow them to dynamically form queen-worker hierarchies. The system focuses on three key APIs to enable users to specify cluster requirements at a high level without needing to define specific hostnames or MAC addresses.

## 3. Product Vision

AWARE will enable users to specify cluster requirements using high-level descriptions (e.g., "a cluster for web traffic with front-end, middleware, database, and storage") and have the system automatically provision appropriate resources. The system will feature automatic node discovery, dynamic queen-worker hierarchy formation, and failover capabilities to ensure continued operation.

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Queen Node Discovery and Election

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** nodes to automatically discover each other and elect a queen  
**So that** I don't need to manually configure cluster hierarchy  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When the system starts with multiple nodes, exactly one becomes the queen
- The election process completes within 60 seconds
- New nodes can join an existing cluster without requiring the queen to be specified
- After queen failure, worker nodes can elect a new queen within 2 minutes

### 4.2 Node Discovery and Communication

**As a** Infrastructure Administrator  
**I want** nodes to automatically discover and form connections  
**So that** I can add new compute resources without manual configuration  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Nodes broadcast their presence using a standardized protocol
- Nodes can join an existing cluster within 2 minutes of starting
- Communication between queen and worker nodes remains reliable even with temporary network issues
- Node discovery works across different network subnets

### 4.3 User Cluster Specification

**As a** Platform User  
**I want** to specify cluster requirements in high-level terms  
**So that** I don't need to define specific hostnames or MAC addresses  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can specify cluster types (e.g., web-tier, database-cluster, compute-pool)
- System can provision appropriate resources based on specified requirements
- Cluster formation completes within 10 minutes for standard configurations
- Users receive notifications about cluster creation progress

### 4.4 Failover and Recovery

**As a** System Administrator  
**I want** the cluster to continue operating if the queen node fails  
**So that** cluster functions remain available during hardware failures  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- New queen is elected within 2 minutes of original queen failure
- Worker nodes recognize the new queen without manual intervention
- Cluster state is preserved during failover
- Connected users are notified of the change

### 4.5 API Communication

**As a** Software Developer  
**I want** reliable APIs to communicate between nodes  
**So that** I can develop applications that interact with the cluster  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Queen-worker API provides 99.9% availability during normal operation
- API response times stay under 100ms for common operations
- API authentication is secure using standard protocols
- API provides comprehensive error handling and status information
