# AWARE Security Report

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AWARE (Autonomous Warehouse Automated Resource Engine) system, including both backend and frontend components.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token Security
- **Algorithm**: Using HS256 algorithm with strong secret keys
- **Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours (configurable via TOKEN_EXPIRY environment variable)
- **Validation**: Implemented proper token validation with checks for expiration and malformed tokens
- **Storage**: Tokens stored securely in localStorage with validation functions

#### Rate Limiting
- **Authentication endpoints**: Limited to 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **General requests**: Limited to 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Login protection**: Prevents brute force attacks on login endpoint

### 2. API Security

#### Security Headers (Helmet)
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts content sources to same origin and safe inline styles
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security to enforce HTTPS
- **Additional protections**: Cross-site scripting protection and other security headers

#### Input Validation
- **Express-validator**: Implemented for request validation
- **Request size limits**: 10MB limit on request bodies to prevent large payload attacks
- **Parameter sanitization**: Validation and sanitization of all input parameters

#### Access Control
- **Role-based access**: Support for different user roles and permissions
- **Protected routes**: Middleware to ensure only authenticated users access protected resources
- **Route-specific validation**: Each route validates required parameters

### 3. Data Security

#### Encryption
- **JWT tokens**: Signed with HS256 algorithm
- **API communication**: Should be deployed with HTTPS in production
- **Password handling**: Credentials validated in a secure manner

#### Error Handling
- **Stack trace protection**: Stack traces not exposed in production
- **Generic error messages**: Detailed errors only in development mode
- **Log sanitization**: Sensitive information not logged

### 4. Frontend Security

#### Token Management
- **Expiration checks**: Tokens validated for expiration before use
- **Format validation**: JWT format verified before storage
- **Secure storage**: Tokens stored in localStorage with validation

#### XSS Protection
- **Recharts library**: Used for data visualization (secure library)
- **Input sanitization**: User inputs properly handled
- **DOM manipulation**: Safe rendering with React's built-in protections

### 5. Infrastructure Security

#### CORS Configuration
- **Origin restrictions**: Configurable allowed origins
- **Credentials**: Proper handling of credentials in cross-origin requests
- **Security headers**: Prevents cross-site request forgery

## Security Best Practices Followed

### Authentication
✅ Strong JWT implementation with proper signing  
✅ Token expiration and validation  
✅ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints  
✅ Secure credential handling  

### Authorization
✅ Role-based access control  
✅ Protected route middleware  
✅ Permission validation for actions  

### Input Validation
✅ Request size limits  
✅ Parameter validation and sanitization  
✅ Error handling without information disclosure  

### Secure Communication
✅ HTTPS readiness (when deployed)  
✅ Security headers implementation  
✅ Secure token handling  

## Recommended Additional Security Measures

### For Production Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with HTTPS in production
2. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Consider using HttpOnly cookies for token storage instead of localStorage
3. **Secret Key Management**: Use proper secret key management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
4. **CORS Policy**: Restrict allowed origins to specific domains only
5. **Database Security**: Ensure any persistent data storage is properly secured
6. **Network Security**: Deploy behind a secure network with proper firewall rules
7. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
8. **Security Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and logging

### For Enhanced Security
1. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Implement MFA for admin accounts
2. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
3. **Session Management**: Implement session management with the ability to revoke tokens
4. **API Rate Limiting**: More granular rate limiting per user/api endpoint
5. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing of the application

## Security Testing

The application includes security-focused tests in the test suite:
- Authentication flow validation
- Authorization checks
- Rate limiting verification
- Input validation testing
- Error handling verification

## Conclusion

The AWARE system implements multiple layers of security to protect against common vulnerabilities. The security measures include authentication, authorization, input validation, security headers, and proper error handling. The system is designed to be deployed securely with proper HTTPS configuration and production-ready security settings.

For production deployment, additional security measures like proper certificate management, infrastructure security, and security monitoring should be implemented as outlined in the recommendations section.
