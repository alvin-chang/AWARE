# AWARE Story: Cluster API Gateway Implementation

## Story ID
AWR-003

## Epic
Core Cluster Functionality

## Story Title
Cluster API Gateway Implementation

## Story Status
Draft

## Story
As a Software Developer, I want reliable APIs to communicate between nodes, so that I can develop applications that interact with the cluster.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Queen-worker API provides 99.9% availability during normal operation
- API response times stay under 100ms for common operations
- API authentication is secure using standard protocols
- API provides comprehensive error handling and status information
- API supports standard REST operations for cluster management

## Tasks
- [x] Set up API server framework
- [x] Implement authentication middleware
- [x] Create API endpoints for cluster operations
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Implement rate limiting and security measures
- [x] Add logging and monitoring endpoints

## Subtasks
- [x] Create API router with all required endpoints
- [x] Implement JWT-based authentication
- [x] Add request/response validation
- [x] Implement API versioning
- [x] Create API documentation
- [x] Add health check endpoints

## Dev Notes
The API gateway will serve as the primary interface for external applications to interact with the AWARE cluster. It should be designed with scalability in mind and follow REST principles. All requests should be authenticated, and we need to implement proper rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Testing
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Load testing to verify performance requirements
- Security testing to verify authentication
