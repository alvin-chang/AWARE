# AWARE Story: Queen Election Algorithm Implementation

## Story ID
AWR-002

## Epic
Core Cluster Functionality

## Story Title
Queen Election Algorithm Implementation

## Story Status
Draft

## Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want nodes to automatically elect a queen when starting a cluster, so that I don't need to manually designate cluster hierarchy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Exactly one node becomes queen when cluster starts
- Election algorithm handles network partitions gracefully
- Election completes within 60 seconds
- Election state is preserved in case of temporary failures
- New queen is elected within 2 minutes of original queen failure

## Tasks
- [x] Research and select appropriate consensus algorithm (Raft)
- [x] Implement core election algorithm
- [x] Add network partition handling
- [x] Add timeout and retry mechanisms
- [x] Test election performance requirements
- [x] Test failure recovery scenarios

## Subtasks
- [x] Create ElectionManager class
- [x] Implement candidate, follower, leader state management
- [x] Add election timeout logic
- [x] Implement vote request/response handling
- [x] Add leader heartbeat mechanism
- [x] Create election persistence layer

## Dev Notes
The queen election uses a modified Raft consensus algorithm. We need to ensure that exactly one queen is elected to avoid split-brain scenarios. The implementation should be fault-tolerant and handle temporary network issues gracefully.

## Testing
- Unit tests for election algorithm
- Failure simulation tests
- Network partition tests
- Performance tests to ensure 60-second requirement

## Dev Agent Record
